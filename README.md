Notice: This project is still under maintainence, I would love your support as I have to dedicate time to a few other projects as of now. The final project will be beautifully integrated into the Python ecosystem with perfect OOPs, Clean Code and the Zen of Python .â˜º

# tasveer
A Python Package to help you quickly download a few images for testing/validation purposes.

**Welcome to Tasveer**

Tasveer is a module to help you download tons of images!

```
pip install tasveer
```
```python
import tasveer as tsv
tsv.download()
```

Once you are done, you will get a prompt to enter queries and number of downloads to do. After you enter, your downloads will be saved in your current directory under downloads/query_entered.

**Future Work**

Feel free to pull. Here's what I plan to work on-

1. Include a lightweight cleaning and processing function

2. Change from prompt to argument
