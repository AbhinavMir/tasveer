# Tasveer
A Python Package to help you quickly download a few images for testing/validation purposes.

**Welcome to Tasveer**

Tasveer is a module to help you download tons of images!

**Usage**

```
pip install tasveer
```
```python
import tasveer as tsv

# Simple usage. Prompts the user for a query and number of images:
tsv.download()

# Using query and count parameters:
tsv.download(query="<SEARCH_STRING>", count="<NUM_IMAGES_AS_INT>")

# Example using parameters: downloads 4 images of books:
tsv.download(query="books", count="4")
```
>**Note:** If you only include one parameter, it will fall back to prompting for the missing parameter.
